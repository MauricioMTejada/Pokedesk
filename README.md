# Pokedesk

This is a project I created as a practice exercise in Next.js.

Pokedesk is an application for viewing Pokémon that relies on the Pokémon API.

After making a request to the API, Pokémon data is retrieved and rendered on the screen.

Users have the option to display details of the sprites when a Pokémon is selected and the ability to mark the character as a favorite. Then, on the 'Favorites' screen, selected Pokémon can be viewed.

The 'Favorites' data is stored in the localStorage, providing persistence even if the page is reloaded.

### Installation:

1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

### Usage:

2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
